	Version V1.2T0

The Tutor's Guide for our book consists mainly of Miranda
code which solves the various exercises.  It does't really contain
much "guidance"!  Still, we hope to improve it, especially in
response to any shortcomings which actually cause you grief (mail us).

Keeping the solutions private
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The book are obviously much less useful as a course text if the
solutions are public knowledge. So please take elementary precautions,
so that your copy is not readable by students.  The easiest thing
to do is probably to make the entire directory readable only by you.

Where the files live
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The files for the Tutor's Guide should live in the same directory
as all the other files for the book.  The Makefile distributed with
the main book already knows about the Tutor's Guide files.


Versions and updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll see the version number of this iteration of the Tutor's Guide
at the top of this file.  It will be something like

	Version V2.9T2

That indicates that this version of the Tutor's Guide relates to
Version V2.9 of the main book, and there have since been 2 updates 
to the Tutor's Guide.

I'll send out each update in the form of a shar file containing the
patch file

	pjlester-2.9T2-2.9T3.diffs

Put this file in the same directory as all the others, and pipe it into

	patch -p1

You must apply any earlier patches first.
